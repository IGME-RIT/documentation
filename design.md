##Abstract
This document describes the design of the [IGM Tutorial Project](https://github.com/IGME-RIT/igme-rit.github.io/) (working title). It outlines the goal of the project, the target audience, and the constraints, and in doing so allows us to design the best project within those limitations.

##Mission Objective
Games education is rapidly approaching a critical juncture. As development tools have become more widely available and publishing restrictions soften, the demand for substantial resources to learn game development has grown tremendously. Likewise, as games and the techniques involved in producing them grow in complexity, the amount of subject coverage professors can give to their students has shrunk proportionally. As an accredited university program with access to industry resources and expertise, the [Interactive Games and Media (IGM)](https://www.rit.edu/gccis/igm/) program at the [Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT)](http://www.rit.edu/) is in an excellent position to look towards the future of games education and act towards the benefit of game developers worldwide. The goal of this project is to __produce a freely-accessible, highly-scalable tutorial platform populated with projects that explore game development topics and illustrate connections with other projects, while opening a door to the open-source community to contribute even more content.__ 

##Constraints
1. __The product should be highly-scalable.__ The site should be capable of handling any number of projects. The back-end should be able to handle a large set of user and project records and rate limits should be kept in mind.

2. __The product should be comprehensive, but imperfect.__ Reimplementing the entire IGM curriculum is a major undertaking well-beyond the scope of the project. Making projects is an important part of content-production, but it is too big a task to create content for all facets of the IGM programs. As such, the means in which projects are loaded from GitHub by the back-end and from the back-end by the front-end should be highly-modularized.

3. __The product should be built in the same spirit as the project.__ The Tutorial Project is designed to make games education accessible to a wider breadth of people. As such, the internals of the Tutorial Project should be well-documented and OSS licensed. They should be hosted on a public source hosting platform such as GitHub and should serve as a referenceable real-world example of its technologies.

##Target Audience
__IGM Students__ - The Tutorial Project lessons should be created with the IGM curriculum in mind. Initial concepts, practices and categories of coverage should be selected around the core and advanced offerings of the IGM department. The Tutorial Project also should consider covering that which the IGM curriculum should cover, but does not. It should present material clearly and concisely, and should not require experience outside of the material and its prerequisite tutorials.

__Non-IGM Students__ - The Tutorial Project should reinforce important concepts and practices to IGM students, but it should be primarily designed with the public in mind. Tutorials should be accessible to anyone with access to GitHub and should not use RIT/IGM-specific terminology or require RIT credentials or IGM-restricted code in order to view and run.

##Resources
The IGM Tutorial Project (working title) will provide access to a potentially enormous selection of tutorials, as well as a system for processing contributions. This section describes the resources we will provide.
