##Abstract
This document describes the design of the [IGM Tutorial Project](https://github.com/IGME-RIT/igme-rit.github.io/) (working title). It outlines the goal of the project, the target audience, and the constraints, and in doing so allows us to design the best project within those limitations.

##Mission Objective
Games education is rapidly approaching a critical juncture. As development tools have become more widely available and publishing restrictions soften, the demand for substantial resources to learn game development has grown tremendously. Likewise, as games and the techniques involved in producing them grow in complexity, the amount of subject coverage professors can give to their students has shrunk proportionally. As an accredited university program with access to industry resources and expertise, the [Interactive Games and Media (IGM)](https://www.rit.edu/gccis/igm/) program at the [Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT)](http://www.rit.edu/) is in an excellent position to look towards the future of games education and act towards the benefit of game developers worldwide. The goal of this project is to __produce a freely-accessible, highly-scalable tutorial platform populated with projects that explore game development topics and illustrate connections with other projects, while opening a door to the open-source community to contribute even more content.__ 

##Constraints
1. __The product should .__ 

2. __The product should be built in the same spirit as the project.__ 

##Target Audience
__IGM Students__ - 

__Non-IGM Students__ - 

__Professors__ - 

##Resources
The IGM Tutorial Project (working title) will provide access to a potentially enormous selection of tutorials, as well as a system for processing contributions. This section describes the resources we will provide.
